 * Reorders the states in the graph so they follow the flow i.e. we perform a basic topological sort.
 *
 * This takes into account the existing ID's and uses them to make decisions on which branches to take first. This
 * allows the user to have some choice in which branch should have a lower ID.
 *
 * This is performed by using a combination of breath and depth searches. If there is only a single path to take then it
 * goes depth first. If there are multiple branches then it adds them to the queue so it goes back to breath first.
 * i.e. This is a fancy floodfill
