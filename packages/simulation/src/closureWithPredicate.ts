/**
 * Compute the set of states accessible from a given state using only transitions that meet the conditions
 * as defined by the given predicate.
 * 
 * @param graph - Graph object used as input
 * @param currentStateID - ID of state used to seed the closure
 * @param predicate - Predicate function
 * @returns A set of pairs where each contains an accessible state and the path of transitions to it.
 * @remark closure will not include starting state
 * @remark closure may include multiple paths to the same state
 * 
 * @example Find states accessible using only transitions that read 'A'.
 * ```ts
 * const closure = closureWithPredicate(graph, 0, transition => transition.read.includes('A'))
 * const states = Array.from(closure).map(([state, path]) => state)
 * ```
 *
 * @example Compute lambda closure from a given state.
 * ```ts
 * closureWithPredicate(graph, 0, transition => transition.read.length === 0)
 * ```
