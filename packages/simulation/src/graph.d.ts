/**
 * This file defines most types used
 *
 * If the type has the `In` suffix then it means it is used when passing data from the frontend
 * to the simulator. These types shouldn't be used in other places. These `In` types are a lot simplier compared
 * to the `Graph` class which is used for simulations
 * TODO: Remove the need for `In` types and just the `Graph` type in frontend
